#SCRIPT USED TO PERFORM RBNA-SPLIT DATA ANALYSIS PIPELINE
#please contact Holly Roach at hmroach@hotmail.co.uk if you have any questions
####################################################################################################################
#IMPORTANT - before running this script make sure you have done the following:
# 1 - In the Watershed_Algorithm_Results folder make sure you have a folder corresponding to the new of your new cell line
#     this file should contain the raw data files for each cropped cloud image that were created by the algorithm on the micron server
#     within this folder there should be subfolders for the Data_Set, Phase and Timepoints used in the analysis
# 2 - makes sure here, tidyverse, stringr, RColorBrewer and tcltk packages have been installed
#     if these are not installed you can run - install.packages("package_name") - in the console
# 3 - make sure you have ran the ImageJ macro (ImageJ_Cloud_Volume.ijm) prior to running this script
# 4 - within the Pulse_Chase_Analysis folder make sure you have created a specific for your new cell line in the Nearest_Neighbour subfolder
#     this folder should contain a nascent_Xist_dynamics and a Xist_turnover_on_chromatin folder
#     within each dataset folder, there should be an EdU_Control and Random_Control folder which contain files corresponding to these controls
#     this only needs to be done for the NNA as subfolders for all other parameters are generated for you by the script
# 5 - make sure that the user inputs in lines 22-96 have been made compatible for your analysis

#MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO RUN THIS SCRIPT

#To run this script, press Ctrl+Shift+S (or Command+Shift+S on Mac)
